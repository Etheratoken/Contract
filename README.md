Ethera Contract

Ethera is a fully decentralized launch platform with instant listing, liquidity blocking and a new improved transaction speed, Ehtera comes to impress in the market, showing its new improved transaction speed. Ethera is Auto-Boost, Hyper Deflationary Coin, with an integrated smart stake system to reward you, so more Ethera Coins are automatically added to your wallet with each transaction.
Ethera is a deflationary currency designed to become more scarce over time. All Ethera holders will earn more Ethera, which is automatically sent to your wallet by simply holding the Ethera coins in your wallet. Watch the amount of Ethera in your wallet grow as all holders automatically receive a 5% fee from every transaction that takes place on the Baby Doge network. The community receives more Ethera coins with the fees generated with each transaction.
Ethera has a fantastic charity project designed for people from underprivileged communities, thus making a donation of 5% of Ethera tokens to a blocked wallet, with a total blocking limit for 1 year, just like that, being unlocked by our charity partners.
Ethera is very generous and is designed to reward long-term owners. The community comes first. Ethera is proud to run with her father and offer transparency and fairness to the community. At the same time making a difference to saving people around the world.

5% of each transaction added to liquidity
5% Of Each Transaction Redistributed to Holders

AutoBoost is a unique feature that was included in our contract. Some are familiar with rebuy tokens, our token is not just another rebuy token.
The Ethera AutoBoost function is mathematically built to make variable buybacks that adjust based on volume to maintain stability. AutoBoost will vary based on transactions over the last 24 hours, which will continue to adjust based on volume.
AutoBoost will buy back variable amounts whenever a sale with the Ethera token occurs. This is a unique function that is more powerful than just a standard rebuy token.


Automatic and manual burning
We burn 29%+ of the supply. This means that of the 5% of the redistribution, 29% will be distributed to the dead wallet. Coins are burned with each transaction.
-
Reward retention
5% of each transaction is redistributed to token holders. This means you can earn more Ethera Coins just by holding them in your wallet.
-
Liquidity Lock
Most LP tokens blocked and some burned.
-
Charity Card
We have a designated charity portfolio that receives redistributions that are used to support our charitable partners.
