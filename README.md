Ethera Contract

Launched in August 2021, Ethera has arrived to leave the best impression in the market. We are a launch pad (cryptocurrency) completely decentralized (independent) with immediate listing, liquidity block and an improved transaction speed.
Designed to become scarcer over time;
Innovating with automatic and manual burning.
Strategically, the business was initially designed with a focus on the growth and experience of the community, respecting and being transparent with the users.

#ABOUT ETHERA
Ethera is not dependent on any government or finance company, no Fees and Taxes, it is a peer-to-peer (Person to Person) transaction thus aiming at the rights of citizens and avoiding the “social engineering” project that is being developed by the authorities with our data.
Improved transaction speeds: you don't have to wait; everything happens practically in "real time".

#AutoBoost:
 AutoBoost is a unique function that was included in our contract. Some are familiar with buyback tokens; our token is not just another buyback token.
Ethera's function AutoBoost is built mathematically to make variable buybacks that adjusts itself based on the volume to maintain stability. Autoboost will vary based on the transactions of the last 24hrs, and will continue to adjust itself based on volume. 
The system will buyback varying quantities every time a sale of Ethera coin happens. This is a unique function that is more powerful than a standard buyback token

#ECOSYSTEM
Designed to become scarcer over time, Each member automatically
receives a % fee of every transaction that takes place on the network.
The community receives more from the fees generated with the EtheraBets
project, which means that when the bookmaker wins, automatically 50% of
the value is purchased from an Ethera token thus valuing the coin
and rewarding its holders Ethera is a project that rewards long-term investors.
